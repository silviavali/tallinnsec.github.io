So, this was not just a regular meetup. Summertime brought on a little bit of a different kind of a meetup for us at the TallinnSec. This time, the event was hosted by the very very awesome, some drum roll here please ... <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/">HackerOne!</a>

It turned out we have become quite international, as we had people from all sides of the world: United States, Japan, Finland, Russia, Portugal and last but not least Estonia of course. 

So cheered up as we are in HackerOne T-shirts, that's us <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/togetherwehitharder?src=hash">#togetherwehitharder</a>.
